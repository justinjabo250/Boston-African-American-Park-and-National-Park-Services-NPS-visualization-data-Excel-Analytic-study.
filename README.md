As a protectional data analyst, I will be using Excel to analyze the visualization data of National Park Services (NPS) and the Boston African American Park analysis project. I will provide all recommendations, measures, and corrections that need to be made, as well as the decisions and solutions that need to be made. All of this will be used to help NPS and Boston African American Park obtain useful and profitable insights from their data.
